/**
 * This class demonstrates the combined use of the Singleton pattern and Connection Pooling.
 *
 * - The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists across the application.
 * - Objecting Pooling pattern maintains a set of reusable object for efficiency and control.
 *
 * Why is this useful?
 * - Without pooling, each client-side request may open a new database connection, leading to:
 *   - High overhead due to expensive connection creation.
 *   - Too many open connections, potentially overwhelming the database.
 *   - In a multithreaded system, threads could fight over connections if not managed properly.
 *
 * Connection pooling addresses these issues by reusing a fixed number of connections.
 * Singleton ensures that this shared pool is managed through a single access point.
 *
 * It would be inefficient to allow multiple instances of a resource manager
 * whose entire purpose is to control and limit such resources â€” hence the need for Singleton.
